# seclook

`seclook` is a security lookup CLI tool that allows you to query various security services on the fly. You can look up information using commands like `seclook [service] [value]`, where the service can be `virustotal`, `shodan`, `emailrep`, and so on. The value is the information you're querying for and varies by service.

## Installation

1. `pip install seclook`
2. Copy `config.ini.sample` from this directory and place it in `~/.seclook/config.ini`
3. Open `~/.seclook/config.ini` and add in your own API keys for the services you want to use

## Usage

Basic usage of `seclook` is as follows:

```bash
seclook [service] [value]
```

For example, to look up IP 1.1.1.1 on VirusTotal, you'd run:

```bash
seclook virustotal 1.1.1.1
```

You can pipe the output to `jq` or `fx` for further processing:

```bash
seclook virustotal 1.1.1.1 | jq
```

You can `grep` the output for known keys to get specific information:

```bash
seclook virustotal 1.1.1.1 | grep malicious
``` 

## Options

`--export` â€“ Use this flag to export the results to a JSON file on your Desktop.
